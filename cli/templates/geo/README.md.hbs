# {{name}}

A geographic information agent built with Pickaxe that provides weather, time, and holiday information for any location.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API keys (the Hatchet token can be generated at [Hatchet Cloud](https://cloud.onhatchet.run) or by [self-hosting Hatchet]((https://docs.hatchet.run/self-hosting))).

3. Run the interactive agent:
```bash
pnpm run trigger
```

## Usage

This will launch an interactive menu where you can:
- Choose from preset queries (weather, time, holidays)
- Enter custom queries
- View results and save them to markdown files

### Development Mode

Run the agent in development mode:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Build and Run

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm start
```
