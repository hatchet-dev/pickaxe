# {{name}}

{{description}} - A comprehensive deep research agent built with Pickaxe that performs multi-iteration web searches to gather, analyze, and synthesize information from multiple sources.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API keys (the Hatchet token can be generated at [Hatchet Cloud](https://cloud.onhatchet.run) or by [self-hosting Hatchet](https://docs.hatchet.run/self-hosting)).

3. Run the agent:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

4. Trigger the interactive CLI:
```bash
pnpm run trigger
```

## Usage

### Interactive CLI

The easiest way to interact with the {{name}} agent is through the interactive CLI:

```bash
pnpm run trigger
```

This will launch an interactive menu where you can:
- Enter research queries for comprehensive investigation
- View detailed research results with sources and analysis
- Save results to markdown files with full citations

### Development Mode

Run the agent in development mode:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Build and Run

Build and run the compiled version:
```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm start
```

## How Deep Research Works

The deep research agent performs sophisticated multi-iteration research:

1. **Query Planning**: Analyzes your question and plans targeted search queries
2. **Web Search**: Searches the web using OpenAI's search preview tool
3. **Content Extraction**: Converts web pages to clean markdown format
4. **Fact Extraction**: Identifies and extracts key facts from each source
5. **Gap Analysis**: Evaluates what information is still missing
6. **Iterative Refinement**: Repeats the process focusing on missing aspects
7. **Synthesis**: Creates a comprehensive summary with full source attribution

## Available Tools

### Search Tool
Performs web searches using OpenAI's advanced search preview.
- Provides high-quality, recent web results
- Includes source URLs and titles
- Optimized for research queries

### Plan Search Tool
Intelligently plans search queries based on existing knowledge and gaps.
- Analyzes what information we already have
- Identifies missing aspects that need investigation
- Generates targeted search queries for maximum information gain

### Website to Markdown Tool
Converts web pages to clean, readable markdown format.
- Removes ads, navigation, and clutter
- Preserves important content structure
- Maintains links and formatting for citations

### Extract Facts Tool
Identifies and extracts key facts from source material.
- Focuses on information relevant to the research query
- Attributes facts to specific sources
- Filters out opinions and maintains objectivity

### Judge Facts Tool
Evaluates whether we have sufficient information to answer the query.
- Assesses completeness of gathered facts
- Identifies specific missing aspects
- Determines if additional research iterations are needed

### Judge Results Tool
Assesses the quality and completeness of the final research.
- Evaluates if the research adequately addresses the original query
- Provides reasoning for completeness assessment
- Ensures research meets quality standards

### Summarize Tool
Synthesizes all gathered information into a coherent, comprehensive summary.
- Combines facts from multiple sources
- Maintains source attribution
- Creates readable, well-structured reports
