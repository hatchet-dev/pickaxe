# {{name}}

{{description}} - A comprehensive deep research agent built with Pickaxe that performs multi-iteration web searches to gather, analyze, and synthesize information from multiple sources.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API keys (the Hatchet token can be generated at [Hatchet Cloud](https://cloud.onhatchet.run) or by [self-hosting Hatchet](https://docs.hatchet.run/self-hosting)).

3. Run the agent:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

4. Trigger the interactive CLI:
```bash
pnpm run trigger
```

## Usage

### Interactive CLI

The easiest way to interact with the {{name}} agent is through the interactive CLI:

```bash
pnpm run trigger
```

This will launch an interactive menu where you can:
- Enter research queries for comprehensive investigation
- View detailed research results with sources and analysis
- Save results to markdown files with full citations

### Development Mode

Run the agent in development mode:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Build and Run

Build and run the compiled version:
```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm start
```
