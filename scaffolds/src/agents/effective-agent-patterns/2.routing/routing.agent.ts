/**
 * ROUTING PATTERN
 * 
 * Based on Anthropic's "Building Effective Agents" blog post:
 * https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents
 * 
 * Pattern Description:
 * Routing classifies an input and directs it to a specialized followup task. 
 * This allows separation of concerns and building more specialized prompts 
 * without one input type hurting performance on others.
 * 
 * When to use:
 * - Complex tasks with distinct categories better handled separately
 * - Classification can be handled accurately by LLM or traditional algorithms
 * - Need specialized handling for different input types
 * 
 * Examples:
 * - Customer service: routing questions, refunds, technical support
 * - Multi-model routing: easy questions to smaller models, hard to larger
 * - Content classification with specialized processors
