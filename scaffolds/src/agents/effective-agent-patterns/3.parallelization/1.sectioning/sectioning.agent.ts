/**
 * SECTIONING PARALLELIZATION PATTERN
 * 
 * Based on Anthropic's "Building Effective Agents" blog post:
 * https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents
 * 
 * Pattern Description:
 * Breaking a task into independent subtasks that run simultaneously, then 
 * aggregating results programmatically. This is one of two parallelization 
 * variations (the other being voting).
 * 
 * When to use:
 * - Independent subtasks can be parallelized for speed
 * - Multiple considerations need separate focused attention
 * - Implementing guardrails alongside main processing
 * 
 * Examples:
 * - Guardrails: One model processes queries while another screens for inappropriate content
 * - Code review: Multiple aspects evaluated simultaneously  
 * - Multi-faceted analysis requiring separate specialized attention
 * 
 * Key Insight:
 * Anthropic found that LLMs generally perform better when each consideration 
 * is handled by a separate LLM call, allowing focused attention on each specific aspect.
