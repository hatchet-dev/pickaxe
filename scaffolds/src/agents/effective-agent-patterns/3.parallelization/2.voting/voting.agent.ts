/**
 * VOTING PARALLELIZATION PATTERN
 * 
 * Based on Anthropic's "Building Effective Agents" blog post:
 * https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents
 * 
 * Pattern Description:
 * Running the same or similar tasks multiple times to get diverse outputs,
 * then using voting logic to determine the final result. This is the second
 * of two parallelization variations (the other being sectioning).
 * 
 * When to use:
 * - Need multiple perspectives for higher confidence results
 * - Quality assurance through consensus
 * - Balancing false positives/negatives with vote thresholds
 * 
 * Examples:
 * - Code vulnerability review with multiple specialized prompts
 * - Content moderation with different evaluation criteria
 * - Quality assessment requiring consensus
 * 
 * Key Insight:
 * Multiple attempts or perspectives can significantly improve confidence in results,
 * especially for subjective or complex evaluation tasks.

    // - Safety: Checks for harmful or inappropriate content
    // - Helpfulness: Evaluates whether the response actually helps the user
    // - Accuracy: Assesses factual correctness and reliability
